# EDCA-Core

**Expression-Driven Cognitive Architecture**  
*A Protocol Layer for Agent Execution and Language-Controlled AI Collaboration*

---

## üîç What is EDCA?

EDCA is a protocol-oriented cognitive framework that transforms natural language expressions into executable agent behaviors.  
It shifts the AI control paradigm from static workflows to **dynamic expression-driven orchestration**.

Unlike prompt chaining or rigid workflow agents, EDCA interprets user intent as a live protocol that governs module activation, decision-making, and semantic interrupts.

## üéØ Why EDCA?

> "Most agents today pretend to be smart by executing workflows. EDCA builds real cooperation by understanding human expression as structured control."

Current ‚ÄúAI agents‚Äù are mostly automated scripts wrapped in LLMs ‚Äî limited, rigid, and disconnected from the user's true intent.

EDCA reclaims agency through language, offering:
- Dynamic path construction based on natural input
- Semantic-level module routing
- Interrupt-driven decision shifting
- Response weight balancing among competing modules

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Expression-Driven Control** | Language input acts as a live execution protocol |
| **Response Weight Shifting** | Modules negotiate control based on semantic priority |
| **Multi-Path Reasoning Chains** | Execution adapts to different cognitive intents |
| **Semantic Interrupts** | User inputs can reroute agent behavior mid-task |
| **Protocol-as-Language** | No pre-defined scripts ‚Äî only real-time negotiation via expression |
